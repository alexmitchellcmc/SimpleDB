Devang Patel & Alex Mitchell2/8/17Lab 1Design Decisions:- We decided to use a HashMap as our underlying data structure in our bufferpool, storing PageId and Page key-value pairs. - A HashMap was also used as the underlying data structure for our Catalog class, which stores, an Integer (DBFile’s.getID()) as a key and  Table as its value. - We used an ArrayList to store TDItems in our TupleDesc. - We used bit operations throughout the assignment in order to read byte[] data.- To keep our HeapPageID’s hashcode functions within Integer.MAXVALUE, we had to mod our concatenation against that value. - In our HeapFileIterator, we used a randomaccessfile throughout the class (in the iterator and in the read page method).   Changes Made To API:We didn’t make any changes outside of the skeleton methods that we were suppose to fill out in order to pass the tests provided. The only changes made outside of the methods already in the system were the creation of iterator classes, which were then returned inside the respective iterator methods for each class.Missing or Incomplete Elements of our Code:The smallTest on the systemTest is the only test that is not passing and we have no idea why. Partner Logistics:Devang Patel and Alex Mitchell worked together on this Lab. They both pair programed through most of it, so that they would both understand what was going on with the code in terms of what was being implements. Times where they didn’t work together included when Devang realized they implemented the bufferpool’s getPage() method incorrectly, and fixed it. Another time is when Alex spent 4 hours trying to debug the error they were receiving with implementing the HeapFileIterator. Altogether, Alex and Devang have worked 16 and 13 hours respectively on this project. Using the RandomAcessFile class for reading a file and using bit operations to read byte data was very difficult and confusing. We also hit a bump trying to figure out why all our tests weren’t passing and implementing the heap file iterator, but the smallTest on the systemTest was not passing and still have no idea why.
